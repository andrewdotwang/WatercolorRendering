# 184 Final Project Proposal: Watercolor Texture Rendering

## Summary & Team members
Team members: Andrew Wang, Evan Lohn, Andrew Wang  

Our final project idea is in the realm of non-photorealistic rendering. More specifically, we plan to utilize several layers of textures along with lighting to mimic & render the apperance of watercolor. 

## Problem Description

## Goals and Deliverables

## Schedule

## Resources
* [Non-Photorealistic Rendering
using Watercolor Inspired Textures and Illumination](https://www.dimap.ufrn.br/~motta/dim102/Projetos/NPR/Lume_PG01.pdf)
* [ART DIRECTED WATERCOLOR SHADER FOR NON-PHOTOREALISTIC
RENDERING WITH A FOCUS ON REFLECTIONS](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154406433.pdf)
* We will be using code from projects 1 & 3 as a starting point for our renderer! We will use project 1's rasterization process and modifying the texture mapping process. We'll also use and modify project 3's lighting and shading methods.
