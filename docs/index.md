# 184 Final Project Proposal: Watercolor Texture Rendering

## Summary & Team members
Team members: Andrew Wang, Evan Lohn, Andrew Wang  

Our final project idea is in the realm of non-photorealistic rendering. More specifically, we plan to utilize several layers of textures along with lighting to mimic & render the apperance of watercolor. 

## Problem Description

As more modern art move to digital forms, computer graphic rendering techniques to mimic traditional hand drawn art forms are becoming popular. One such art form is water colors, where artists draw charming images through the blending of rich and vibrant colors. Our group was especially interested in the non-photorealistic rendering of watercolor-esque images. This marks a contrast from the typical photorealism focus in traditional computer graphics, allowing for more artistic flexibility and expression.  

## Goals and Deliverables

## Schedule

## Resources
* [Non-Photorealistic Rendering
using Watercolor Inspired Textures and Illumination](https://www.dimap.ufrn.br/~motta/dim102/Projetos/NPR/Lume_PG01.pdf)
* [ART DIRECTED WATERCOLOR SHADER FOR NON-PHOTOREALISTIC
RENDERING WITH A FOCUS ON REFLECTIONS](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154406433.pdf)
* We will be using code from projects 1 & 3 as a starting point for our renderer! We will use project 1's rasterization process and modifying the texture mapping process. We'll also use and modify project 3's lighting and shading methods.
